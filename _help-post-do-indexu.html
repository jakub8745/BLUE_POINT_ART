                    The art installation 'Milkmaids Pitcher' was created during
                    nights&weekends - a six-week programme organised by Buildspace in which
                    we brought our various
                    ideas to life. It was not easy! I was so busy building my installation
                    that I didn't have enough time for social media. As a result, I finished
                    in 200th place. I was competing against 3500 other ideas. That's not
                    bad, is it? I had an idea for an art object. Purely artistic,
                    conceptual.
