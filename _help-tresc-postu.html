                        The art installation 'Milkmaids Pitcher' was created during
                        nights&weekends - a six-week programme organised by Buildspace in which
                        we brought our various
                        ideas to life. It was not easy! I was so busy building my installation
                        that I didn't have enough time for social media. As a result, I finished
                        in 200th place. I was competing against 3500 other ideas. That's not
                        bad, is it? I had an idea for an art object. Purely artistic,
                        conceptual.</p>

                    <p>
                        Not that I'm not horrified by humanity's social, climate or
                        health problems, but I've never been, I'm not, and I'm not likely to be
                        a good activist, so I'll leave that to others. What interested me was
                        whether it would be possible to divide one of my sculptures - the
                        milkmaid's pitcher - and place each part in different virtual worlds. So
                        that when we combine these parts conceptually or in our imagination, we
                        are in a way combining different, often completely different worlds.

                    <p>A bit like in those fractions of a second when we are no longer asleep
                        and
                        still feel the reality of sleep, as if two states of concentration exist
                        simultaneously. </p>

                        The pitcher is divided by a model of a splash of milk.
                        The result is an animated sculpture, a kind of generative art with an
                        emphasis on code art. The performance of code, the contact between the
                        tools of programming languages and the matter of different digital
                        worlds, is where the possibility of art can arise. For me it is about
                        how to sculpt with code in the matter of the digital metaverse.<br />
                        <br />The 'Milkmaid's Pitcher is available on devices that support WebXR
