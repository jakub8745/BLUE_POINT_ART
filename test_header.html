          The exhibition <i>'Vincenz's Dialogues - Views'</i> presents a fascinating series of photographs
          by Lidio Cipriani,
          who, following in the footsteps of Stanisław Vincenz, presented the Hutsul
          region in a completely new light. At the exhibition, we will see unusual
          photographs that go beyond the boundaries of traditional ethnographic and
          touring documentation. The photographs are from the Lidio Cipriani archive, owned by Professor
          Jacopo Moggi-Cecchi of the University of Florence.
          We sincerely thank them for sharing the photos with us.
